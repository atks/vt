Release 1.0: 23rd Feb 2021
--------------------------

This marks the first non-beta release of htscodecs, following a
perioid of integration with Htslib and automated fuzzing by Google's
OSS-Fuzz program.

[Note this testing only applies to the C implementation.  The
JavaScript code should still be considered as examples of the codecs,
more for purposes of understanding and clarity than as a fully
optimised and tested release.]

Since the last release (0.5) the key changes are:

- Improved support for big endian platforms

- Speed improvements to CRAM 3.0 4x8 rANS order-1 encoding.
  It's between 10 and 50% faster at encoding, based on input data.

- Improved autoconf bzip2 checks and tidy up "make test" output.

- Added some more files into "make install", so that "make distcheck"
  now passes.

- Replaced Travis with Cirrus-CI testing.

- Removed various C undefined behaviour, such as left shifting of
  negative values and integer overflows.  As far as we know these were
  currently harmless on the supported platforms, but may break future
  compiler optimisations.

- Fixed numerous OSS-Fuzz identified flaws.  Some of these were
  potential security issues such as small buffer overruns.

- Tidied up some code to prevent warnings.

- The name tokeniser now has a limit on the size of data it can encode
  (10 million records).  This may still be too high given the memory
  it will require, so it may be reduced again.
